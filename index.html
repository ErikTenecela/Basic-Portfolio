            <p>Hello classmates, I will talk about my everyday routine such as my school, sports, and culture.
                Starting with my school I'm a student in HCC(Housatonic Community College) I currently am a sophomore
                with 33 credits. My major is Computer Science the reason why I choice this career field was due to
                the fact I will have a better salary in the long-run.<br><br>
                Next, is my favorite hobbies soccer. I played a lot sports when I was growing up but the one I love
                the most is soccer maybe it was because I was Hispanic.
                I played defense in my soccer team though we did lose every game we played I never care about that
                I just like that I can meet many people who love the sport I do and made a lot of friends cause of
                this sport.<br><br>
                Lastly, it's my culture Ecuador that's where my parents are from growing up I met many Ecuadorians
                like me. We would play volley ball but also bet money it can range from 20$ to 100$ per match
                winners take the loser team money. I also like eating cuy which is a Ecuadorian thing we would usually
                eat this on big occasions such as birthdays party, parade, festivals, etc. These are some of my personal
                life that I like the most.
