    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello classmates, today I will share my personal life about my daily routines, personality, and much more.
        Starting off with college I attend Housatonic Community College for a year pursuing the degree of CS
        <em>(Computer Science)</em>I
        found myself doing very excellent in my overall courses along the way I met many people who were very supportive
        with each other.
        This was a big help due to the fact I lacked confidence in myself when it came to big test's that would effect
        my overall course
        they gave me the extra push in myself that I thought I never had before.
    </p>
